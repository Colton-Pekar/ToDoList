# ToDoList

Good morning Erik, Ryan, and Mina. Here is my ASP .Net Core To Do List website using razer pages. 
In appsettings.json, I declare my default connection for the sql server name as '(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB'
You may have to migrate the class to the db and then proceed with 'update-database'.
To run the application, open the solution in Visual Studio (I used 19) with the sql server connected.
Press the green play button (as you would obviously know) and let the application pop up

The main page will be your 'active to do list' where you can view and mark tasks as complete
The modify list button will bring you to a separate page where you may:
  1) Add a new item to the list.
  2) Edit an item that is currently on the list (task or when it is due).
  3) Delete an item that is on the list if you wish.
  
I really wanted to add extra functionality tonight such as ordering the rows for what is due next
and potentially sending push notifications to the user, but I had gotten laser eye surgery yesterday
and even now my eyes are pretty strained/blurry typing this read me (sorry if there is typos).

This was a lot of fun to make, and I hope it runs/exceeds your expectations upon trying. 

Also if for some reason you cannot retrieve all of the files properly off of here,
let me know and I will email you a zip file of them all.

Talk to you guys Monday!
